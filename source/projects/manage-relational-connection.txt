You can use the :guilabel:`Manage` button on the :guilabel:`Schema model` 
pane to make changes to the schemas or tables you want to include in 
your migration project. You can also connect to the source database 
or use a {+ddl+} file to refresh the list of available tables.

Add or Remove Tables from a Project
-----------------------------------

To change the tables you're migrating from your relational database, use 
the :guilabel:`Manage` button.

1. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click the :guilabel:`Manage` button on the 
   :guilabel:`Schema model` pane.

#. Click the check box next to the schema or schemas you are migrating. 

#. To expand the tables in a schema, click the :icon-fa5:`chevron-right`
   button.

   Select the tables you want to add or remove from your migration.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 

   Changes from your relational database are reflected in the main 
   Relational Migrator diagram and included in future migration jobs.

Refresh Schema Changes
----------------------

If your relational database table structure changes, use the 
:guilabel:`Refresh Schema` button to let Relational Migrator know. 

1. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click the :guilabel:`Manage` 
   button on the :guilabel:`Schema model` pane.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Refresh schema` button on the Manage 
   relational model modal.

#. Select either :ref:`Connect to database <connect-to-db>` or 
   :ref:`Import DDL File  <import-ddl-file>`.

.. _connect-to-db:

Connect to database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Connect to database` rescans the schema. Changes in foreign key 
relations or data types for the underlying tables are read into Migrator.

1. Input the :guilabel:`JDBC URI`, :guilabel:`Username` and 
   :guilabel:`Password` for the database instance you are connecting to. 

   The account used can be different from the credentials you used when 
   creating the project.

   .. note::
   
      Relational Migrator remembers the MongoDB URI and the username but not 
      the password. When you refresh the schema, re-enter the password.

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect`. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 
   
   Any changes from your relational database are reflected in 
   the main Relational Migrator diagram and included in future 
   migration jobs.

.. _import-ddl-file:

Import DDL File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Import DDL File` opens a file prompt that accepts a {+ddl+} file of the 
relational schema you are migrating. Any changes in the foreign key relations or 
data types for the underlying tables are read into Migrator.


1. Select your :guilabel:`Database type`.

   Relational Migrator currently supports the following database types:

   - MySQL
   - Oracle
   - PostgreSQL
   - SQL Server

#. Choose a file or drag and drop a {+ddl+} statement file.

#. Click :guilabel:`Import`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 

   Any changes from your relational database are reflected in the main 
   Relational Migrator diagram and included in future migration jobs.
