You can rename diagrams on the Mapping tab of Relational Migrator.
Relational Migrator displays diagram names on the ribbon tab of the
Mapping view. 

About this Task
---------------

Renaming diagrams allows you to customize your diagrams' properties. You
can view your diagram names on the ribbon tab of the Mapping view and in
the Diagram Properties box. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the diagram you want to rename. 

      When you navigate to the diagram you want to remane, Relational
      Migrator displays it as the active diagram. 

   
   .. step:: Click the arrow button on the right of the window to open
   the Diagram Properties Box.

         :alt: Diagram Properties box
      
      This shows the diagram name and notes. By default, Relational
      Migrator names diagrams in the order they were created and leaves
      the notes field empty. 

   .. step:: Type your new diagram name in the name box. 

      The diagram name is saved automatically and the ribbon tab updates
      the diagram name accordingly.
