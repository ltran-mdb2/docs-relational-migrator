You can create new diagrams on the Mapping tab of Relational Migrator.
You can also create multiple diagrams and navigate between them to view
specific entities of your data model. By default, Relational Migrator
creates the ``Main Diagram`` diagram with a Relational view and a
MongoDB view.

About this Task
---------------

Creating diagrams allows you to visualize tables, foreign key
relationships, and data types in different formats. After you create a
diagram, you can :ref:`clone <rm-clone-diagrams>`, :ref:`rename
<rm-rename-diagrams>`, and :ref:`delete <rm-delete-diagrams>` your new
diagrams. 

You must have at least one digram on your ribbon tab. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Click the plus sign button on the right of the workspace
             tab. 
   
      This creates and opens a blank diagram. By default, the diagram
      view pane hides all entities in the project.

      When you create a new diagram, Relational Migrators displays it on the
      Mapping tab. 

.. note::

   Diagram tabs appear in the order that the diagrams were created. You
   cannot reorder diagram tabs.
