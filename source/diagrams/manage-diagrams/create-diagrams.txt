You can create new diagrams in the Mapping tab of Relational Migrator.
After you create a diagram, you can clone, rename, and delete your new
diagrams. 

To create a new diagram, click the plus sign button on the right of the
workspace tab. This creates and opens a blank diagram. By default, the
diagram view pane hides all entities in the project.

When you create a new diagram, the new diagram is the active diagram
that Relational Migrator displays. 

.. note::

   Diagram tabs appear in the order that the diagrams were created. You
   cannot reorder diagram tabs.
