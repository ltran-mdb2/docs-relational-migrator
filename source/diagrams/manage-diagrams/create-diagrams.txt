You can create new diagrams on the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen of
Relational Migrator. You can also create multiple diagrams and navigate
between them to view specific entities of your data model. By default,
Relational Migrator creates the :guilabel:`Main Diagram` diagram with a
Relational view and a MongoDB view.

About this Task
---------------

- Creating diagrams allows you to visualize tables, foreign key
  relationships, and data types. 
- After you create a diagram, you can
  :ref:`clone <rm-clone-diagrams>`, :ref:`rename <rm-rename-diagrams>`,
  and :ref:`delete <rm-delete-diagrams>` your new diagram. 
- You must have at least one digram on your ``Diagram Toolbar``. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button on the right of the
   Diagram Toolbar. 
   
      .. image:: /img/diagrams/create_diagram.png
         :alt: Create Diagram in Diagram View Pane

      This creates and opens a blank diagram. By default, the diagram
      view pane hides all entities in the project. When you create a new
      diagram, Relational Migrator displays it on the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen. 

      .. note::

         Diagram tabs appear in the order that the diagrams were created. You
         cannot reorder diagram tabs.
