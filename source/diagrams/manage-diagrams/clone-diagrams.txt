You can clone existing diagrams on the Mapping tab of Relational
Migrator. 

About this Task
---------------

You can clone one or more diagrams to create new diagrams that contain
the same entities as existing diagrams. Once you clone a diagram, you
can edit, :ref:`rename <rm-rename-diagrams>`, and :ref:`delete
<rm-delete-diagrams>` your new diagram. 


Steps

      Diagram Properties pane.

      notes.

   .. step:: Click the Duplicate Diagram option

      This create and opens a new diagram with the same entities as the
      duplicated diagram. The visibility of entities on your new diagram
      is identical to the visibility of entities on the duplicated
      diagram. 
      
      .. note :: 

         Relational Migrator does not clone the duplicated diagram's
         name and notes to the new diagram.
