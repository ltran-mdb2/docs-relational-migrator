Diagrams function as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool to
visualize tables, foreign key relationships, and data types. Diagrams
help you understand the relational database's schema, and show you how
to best represent relational data in MongoDB. Diagrams also show how
your mapping rules shape the target MongoDB schema.

When you finish :ref:`creating a migration project
<rm-create-project-live>`, Relational Migrator creates a new diagram
based on your project's mapping rules. The diagram is comprised of two
views:

- A Relational view, representing the tables in your relational
  database

- A MongoDB view, representing the collections in your target MongoDB
  database

When you :ref:`edit mapping rules <mapping-rules-edit>` for your
project, the MongoDB view automatically updates to reflect the new
rules.

The relational view is unaffected by mapping rules, and only changes
when you update your project's data model.

  You can also use `Hackolade <https://hackolade.com/>`__ to 
  visualize your schemas.
